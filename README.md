# Amber
Amber is an application installer and manager for jailbroken iOS devices.

## Features
* Installer - Amber allows you to easily sideload .ipa and .app files to your device with whichever arbitrary entitlements you may choose.
* Application information - Amber can give you an insight into the apps on your device, such as their entitlements, their code-signing status and more.
* Native UI - Amber features a smooth, native SwiftUI-built interface that is optimised for both iPhones and iPads to ensure it remains appealing on any and every device.

The application manager is currently finished, but the installation methods are still under development.
